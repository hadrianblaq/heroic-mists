#Heroic Mists Help

This is a custom theme for Ghost (https://en.ghost.org). The look and feel of the theme was originally inspired by Medium (http://medium.com) but evolved to include some layout elements from John O'Nolan's blog.(http://john.onolan.org). 

This theme has been made possible by the liberal use of these technologies:
 * Purecss.io (http://purecss.io)
 * Elusive-Icons Webfont (http://shoestrap.org/downloads/elusive-icons-webfont/)
 * Roboto and Open Sans fonts from Google 
 
 
#Installation

1. Copy the contents of the .zip file into /content/themes/. 

2. You need to restart your Ghost instance. After that you can switch themes inside your Ghost admin (http://your.domain.com/ghost/settings/general/). Scroll down and choose "Heroic Mists".

3. Now you can customize your logo, langing page image, as well as user images and texts to fit the theme.

4. Have fun.
